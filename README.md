# Wordle-Clone
Wordle has recently taken the world by storm and turning its creator to a millionaire. This game rule is simple, you have 6 tries to guess a mystery word. And on each try, the game will indicate how correct your guess was so you can ultimately put together the answer. This is my take on re-creating this awesome game :)

## Tech Stack
- ReactJS
- JSON Server

## Features
- Color-coded guessed letters (yellow, gray, green) to help player with their next guess
- Generate mystery words from the official Wordle's dictionary
- Support togglable Themes

### `npm clone https://github.com/quang08/Wordle_Clone.git`
